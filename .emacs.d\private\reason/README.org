#+TITLE: Reason layer around reason-mode

* Description

This is some hacks I've done to get a Spacemacs layer around [[https://github.com/facebook/reason/tree/master/editorSupport/emacs][reason-mode]] found in
the [[https://github.com/facebook/reason][reason]] repo.

* Install

Clone this repo into  =~/.emacs.d/private/reason=.
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =reason= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file. Also make sure you have =ocaml= layer included, since =reason= uses Merlin
(and only one layer can be in control of a package).



If you get the following at startup:
=An error occurred while post-configuring company in layer reason (error: (void-function spacemacs|add-company-backends))=

The spacemacs|add-company-backend function is a recent addition in the develop branch; see https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.develop#breaking-changes and also [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/commit/74fdbb6][syl20bnr/spacemacs@74fdbb6]].
