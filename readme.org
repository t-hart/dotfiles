* Dotfiles
  Second attempt at creating a dotfiles repo, using the approach described in [[https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/][this article]].

** Submodules
   This repo contains a couple submodules with additional configuration, so make sure to check out the submodules as well.

** Cloning
   For cloning the repo and setting it up on new machines, the author recommends the following command: ~git clone --bare <git-repo-url> $HOME/dotfiles~
   Check the article for a more in-depth explanation

   It would be worth looking into whether --recurse-submodules works when cloning with `--bare`.
    Something like this should take care of it (though note that I have not tested it yet):

    #+begin_src sh
      alias dot="git --git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME"
      git clone --bare https://github.com/t-hart/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
      dot checkout
      dot submodule update --init --recursive
    #+end_src
